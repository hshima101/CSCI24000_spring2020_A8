The goal is to make a pet program that utilizes abstract classes to build a specific animal and to utilize serialization to save and load a pet. The program will start with making an abstract pet class that will set the charictaristics of the animals. For this program I will start by making a turtle class that will be build with the classes from the abstract pet class. all of these functions will be called from the main Menu class where the users turtle will be constructed. The user will be goive four thigs to do with the turtle, Feed, Play, Sleep, and end. Feeding will add value to a hunger value which will tell the user how the turtle is feeling, bloated, full, hungry, and famished. Play will add to a happiness value which will tell the user how the turtle is feeling, overjoyed, happy, board, depressed. Sleep will just reduce hunger and happiness by 10 points, then End will save the users pet into a .dat file. The user will be greeted with a choice at the beginning. If the user chooses the first choice, the program will let the user make a new turtle. If the user choses the second choice, the program will load an existing turtle from the .dat file.
